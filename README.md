# Data Mining Algorithms

Some of the Data Mining algorithms like Apriori, K Means, Decision Trees etc, without using any ML libraries like Scikit-Learn

## Algorithms

### 1. Decision Tree Classifier
      
A Simple Classification algorithm using Decision Trees using Entropy
      
### 2. Gini Index for Decision Tree Classifier

Decision Tree algorithm using Gini Index
      
### 3. Association Rules - Apriori
      
Gives the Most Frequent Item Sets from the given dataset.
      
### 4. Association Rules - Partition

Here the given data is divided into n parts and then apriori algorithm is applied onto the it. Later the frequent sets are combined       together and then a frequent set is generated from it.
      
### 5. Clustering - K Medoids

Simple Clustering Algorithm using K - Medoids
      
### 6. Clustering - K Means

Clustering using K-Means algorithm
